This is a dummy file that is a placeholder for a real ssh key used for
git repo access. If you are just cloning a public read only https://  git repo, and do not need
to update git, you can leave this as is.

You can also replace this with a real ssh key (id_rsa), or use kubectl commands to
create the secret. See bin/setup-git-creds.sh
