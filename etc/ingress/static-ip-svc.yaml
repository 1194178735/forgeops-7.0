# According the docs https://github.com/kubernetes-incubator/external-dns/blob/master/docs/tutorials/nginx-ingress.md
# This is the recommended way to run an nginx ingress on GKE.
# This uses the GKE outer load balancer to route to the nginx load balancer inside the cluster. 
# It will give you an Anycast external IP without needing to expose your minion nodes
