# DJ persistence switch. Setting to false disables volume claims - all data is stored inside the docker image.
# Used in testing environments without pv providers. When the pod is terminated, the DJ data will be deleted!
# See issue https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/2630,
# which impacts minikube (or any hostPath based provisioner). The underlying PV has root permissions,
