# Sample value overrides for Helm. The values below will work out of the box, and
# are the same as the default values.yaml in the charts.
# To override these values, make a copy of this file, and pass it to helm with the -f option
# Example:  helm install -f my-custom.yaml openam
# *DO NOT* check your custom.values file into git, as it may contain ssh credentials. See below


# Global variables are used in all charts, including child charts nested under a parent chart.
# Refer to https://github.com/kubernetes/helm/blob/master/docs/charts.md#scope-dependencies-and-values for more information
# Be careful of proper yaml nesting here.
