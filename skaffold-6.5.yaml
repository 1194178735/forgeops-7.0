# skaffold -f skaffold-6.5.yaml dev
# For creating your own custom skaffold profiles we recommend making a copy of this
# file to skaffold-dev.yaml (which is in .gitignore).
# You can "mix and match" diferent services together by creating skaffold profiles
# and by creating a new kustomize profile in kustomize/6.5/env


# The default below for skaffold dev is to deploy all services in one shot:
